## History

v1.6.0-beta, August 31, 2010
- Added Ajaxy form demo.
- Added Ajaxy.onReady, Ajaxy.onDocumentReady and Ajaxy.onConfigured promises
- Controllers should now use classname instead of selector. B/C Break.
- $.fn.addAjaxy now supports passing a controller so we can add the Controller.classname to the element(s)
- Added $.fn.addAjaxy and $.fn.removeAjaxy
- State.actionCompleted callback now supports options.
- Added Refresh Action, this is triggered when we click the same Ajaxy link twice. If the refresh action does not exist a log will be outputted, and the Response action will be used instead. B/C Partial Break.
- Improvements to the anchor handling, page tracking and scrolling.
- While in postponed mode, and a anchor is clicked, we will treat the anchor as normal and not perform a redirect.
- Added postpone and disable redirect option values. Postpone will postpone ajaxy functionality until the page is changed. Disable will disable ajaxy functionality all together.

- Updated jQuery History dependencies to [v1.4.1-beta, August 05, 2010]

v1.5.0-beta, August 03, 2010
- Renamed format to extractHash. This change may break backwards compatibility in advanced cases.
- Added support for anchors. This now requires a call to [var Action = this; this.documentReady()] once the content has updated to inform Ajaxy that it can take care of anchors now. See the updated JavaScript in the demo for more information. To do this we have included Ariel Flesler's $.fn.scrollTo with Balupton's $.fn.ScrollTo extension.
- Added auto_ajaxify_documentReady option
- Added auto_sparkle_documentReady option
- Removed dependency on JSON2, instead we use jQuery's parseJSON
- Fixed track providing 3 slashes issue
- Fixed redirect issue
- History requirement is now bundled into built jQuery Ajaxy script, so no need to include both anymore. This saves space as History and Ajax share some dependencies.
- Updated jQuery History dependencies to [v1.4.0-beta, August 03, 2010]
- This release may be a final release if no bugs are found.

- Added #current to demo, to be similar to the jQuery History demo
- Fixed SEO in the demo by using [./] on the pages instead of [/]

- The Controller, State and Action are now separate entities. Instead of doing [this.response_data] or [this.data.response] you now do [this.State.Response.data]
- All references to Hash have been renamed to State appropriately
- We now support loading in complete HTML documents. Will find content and title automatically.
