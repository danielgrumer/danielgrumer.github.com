		<h2>About</h2>
		
		<p>
			<strong>jQuery Ajaxy</strong> allows you to easily upgrade your web site into a full featured Ajax web application. Anyone who has tried to do this themselves would no doubt have spent countless hours debugging tedious javascript ajax requests, trying to figure out how to get ajax pages bookmarkable and working with back and forward buttons, or even struggled to add javascript effects to help manage your pages. jQuery Ajaxy was developed to solve all these problems, as well as some you may have never encountered such as; How do I keep my page indexable by Search Engines while making it an Ajax Application, How do I keep my site accessible to those who have javascript disabled? How I ensure I send the correct page back to the browser?
		</p>
		
		<p>All of those problems are extremely difficult to solve, which is why we've solved them for you. We've made it so:</p>
		
		<ul class="features">
			<li>It's unbelievably simple to upgrade your ordinary links and forms into Ajax requests by just adding a CSS classname.</li>
			<li>You already have automatic support for tracking state changes in your now web application so you don't have to worry about this at all - we do it for you. This allows it so the user can still use those back and forward buttons, or even send the page URL to a friend and see the same thing!</li>
			<li>You can even submit forms via Ajax with confidence, without having to do any extra server side code.</li>
			<li>You will also have the ability to control your web applications state manually through your code for advanced circumstances.</li>
			<li>You will still have support for classical anchors despite us using hashes for our web application states! This means you can still direct your users to particular content on a webpage using a link like: <code>my/web/page.html#the-content-to-scroll-to</code></li>
		</ul>
		
		<p>We've included a nice demo below so you can see all of this in action.</p>
	</div>
	
	<div class="section using" id="using">
		<h2>Using jQuery Ajaxy</h2>
		
		<h3>Seeing it work</h3>
		
		<p>The following demo is perhaps overly simplistic, but we know the simpler something is; the simpler it is to understand what is going on. So let's get started by clicking through the tabs/links to change the content and update our state.</p>
		
		<div id="demo">
			<ul id="menu">
				<li><a href="./pages/apricots.html" class="ajaxy ajaxy-page">Learn about Apricots</a></li>
				<li><a href="./pages/bananas.html" class="ajaxy ajaxy-page">Lean about Bananas</a></li>
				<li><a href="./pages/coconuts.html" class="ajaxy ajaxy-page">Learn about Coconuts</a></li>
				<li><a href="./pages/durians.html#yummy" class="ajaxy ajaxy-page">Learn about Durians</a></li>
				<li><a href="./pages/eggplants.php" class="ajaxy ajaxy-page">Have your say about Eggplants</a></li>
			</ul>
			<div id="result">
				<div id="content" style="max-height:100px;overflow:auto;"></div>
				<div id="current"></div>
			</div>
		</div>
		
		<p>
			As you clicked through these, you would have noticed the content kept changing. If you have a eye for detail, you may have noticed that the page's URL hash also kept changing - this is how we track the state of our application. And if you are really really keen, you may have even noticed the page's title was also changing appropriately for each click.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			Now let's mix it up a bit. Click the forward and back buttons in your browser. Watch as it correctly recreates the states of your browsing history. Isn't that cool! Now refresh the page, and notice how the correct state was again recreated. Or even copy the URL, open a new tab, and stick the URL in there and go. Again the state was created. This is soo important, as it allows you to keep track of the state of you application, and the best thing is that it all happens automatically for you - Ajaxy handles it all leaving you to focus on what is important.
		</p>
		
		<h3>The code responsible</h3>
		
		<p>
			All of these changes happen because we have upgraded those normal <code>a</code> elements into full featured rich Ajax links. We did this by simple adding the following CSS classes to the links: <code>ajaxy</code> and <code>ajaxy-page</code>. The first CSS class tells Ajaxy that this link is one to be upgraded, and the second is defined by our demo page to say we should use the page controller. Let's see the complete HTML before we move on:
		</p>
		
		<p>The HTML:</p>
		<pre class="code language-html">
			&lt;ul id="menu"&gt;
				&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="./pages/apricots.html" class="ajaxy ajaxy-page"&gt;Learn about Apricots&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
				&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="./pages/bananas.html" class="ajaxy ajaxy-page"&gt;Lean about Bananas&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
				&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="./pages/coconuts.html" class="ajaxy ajaxy-page"&gt;Learn about Coconuts&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
				&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="./pages/durians.html#yummy" class="ajaxy ajaxy-page"&gt;Learn about Durians&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;/ul&gt;
			&lt;div id="result"&gt;
				&lt;div id="content" style="max-height:100px;overflow:auto;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
				&lt;div id="current"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
			&lt;/div&gt;
		</pre>
		
		<p>
			Pretty simple isn't it. So let's explain what each element is.
			The <code>div#demo</code> is the container for our demo, such that we can separate it from this text explaining what it is.
			The <code>ul#menu</code> contains all our links which effectively act as tabs.
			Each <code>li.ajaxy.ajaxy-page</code> are all our tab links, they are all linked to the actual Ajax content we would like to load in - such that a search engine can still index our website, and we can be as graceful as possible in upgrading our site.
			The <code>div#result</code> is the container for the two result elements we will be using.
			The <code>div#content</code> is where our tab content will be loaded into.
			The <code>div#current</code> is where we display what the current state is of our web application.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			So it pretty much looks just like how you would code it up without Ajax doesn't it? With the exception of the CSS classnames we added.
			So what will this code do? Well when our page loads, Ajaxy will look for all elements with the <code>ajaxy</code> class name, and upgrade them into a Ajax link.
			Once that link is then clicked, Ajaxy will perform a Ajax request and let us know it's sent off a request such that we can do any fadeOuts or loading animations we would like.
			Once Ajaxy has received the response from our server, it'll then try and figure out what we received - did we received a 404 not found? invalid data? text or JSON? - Ajaxy will handle it all for us.
			It'll then inform us of a valid response or a error occurred and pass us all the data we need to display our fetched content in our page.
			- It may sound a bit complicated, but all of that complicated stuff is happening in the background and being handled by Ajaxy and not us! Youhou! So that means we can focus on what matters - telling Ajaxy which links we want to use with Ajax, and animating and populating our content when requests or responses are performed.
		</p>
		
		<p>So now we got that out the way, let's get into the javascript. We've documented the code inline as detailed as we can, rather than splitting the code up into segments. As at least for me, reading comments inline is a lot better than detached segments of code as you can't see the big picture. So here you are the big picture with lots of comments.
		
		<p>The JavaScript:</p>
		<pre class="code language-javascript">
		/**
		 * Create a local noconflict scope.
		 * This is important as perhaps we are running in an noConflict environment so $ is not defined, but jQuery is.
		 * What this will do is alias $ to jQuery, such that we can still write our code exactly the same as if we weren't in a noConflict environment.
		 * Another important thing is that this allows us to create a local scope.
		 * Local scopes are important they avoid variable overwrites and keeps our code nice and tidy.
		 */
		(function($){
			/**
			 * Fetch the element we will be using.
			 * We assign them to variables as that way they are cached in our local scope.
			 * This is good as say if we do $('#menu') three times, that is 3 times that jQuery has to find the #menu element. Causing unecessary load.
			 */
			var $body = $(document.body),
				$menu = $('#menu'),
				$content = $('#content'),
				$current = $('#current');
			
			/**
			 * Configure Ajaxy
			 * We now proceed to configure Ajaxy.
			 * We have to do this as otherwise, Ajaxy wouldn't know what to do with our Ajax data!
			 * It would just perform a request, receive a response, and then go... well what do I do now?
			 * So here we tell Ajaxy how to handle the different types of states we will have in our application.

			See that is tiny considering what we have just accomplished. And especially considering the power and magnitude of what we have just unleashed into your web application. Now compare that to how many hundreds upon hundreds lines of codes it would have taken to write everything we did today from scratch, and then imagine just how messy that alternative could be! I've been there, it can be hideous! So just sit back right now, and just think of what is now accomplishable right there at your finger tips. And think of all the great fantastic new projects you can make. Or even think just how nice your code will be. You'll be the envy of everyone! Woohoo.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			So I do hope that you can truly see the awesomeness of what you have just gone through. You are now prepared with everything you need to get cracking on your own Web 2.0 applications. You can see installation details below. And you can always send us questions and feedback about this project and how you can use it, by clicking the support link up the top or the feedback button on the right. Happy coding! :-)

		<h2>Installation</h2>
		
		<h3>Step 1. <a href="http://github.com/balupton/jquery-ajaxy/zipball/master" title="Download the Latest">Download</a> jQuery Ajaxy, and extract it to your hard drive</h3>
		<div>
			As everyones extraction process is a little bit different be sure of the following:
			<ul class="install">
				<li>If the archive was extracted and you have a whole bunch of files and directories (folders), then you must create a new directory called <code>jquery-ajaxy</code> and move all the files and directories into that to continue.</li>
				<li>If the archive was extracted and you have only one directory called <code>jquery-ajaxy</code> which has a whole bunch of stuff in it, then that is fine and you can continue onto the next step.</li>
				<li>If the archive was extracted and you have only one directory and it is not called <code>jquery-ajaxy</code> then you must rename it to <code>jquery-ajaxy</code> to continue.</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
		
		<h3>Step 2. Move the <code>jquery-ajaxy</code> directory to somewhere on your webserver</h3>
		<p>Be sure to always keep the entire <code>jquery-ajaxy</code> directory intact; this means if you were to only move some of the files instead of moving the entire directory, then you would run into problems due to the cross directory references would no longer be working.</p>
		
		<h3>Step 3. Include jQuery (insert into your page's head tag)</h3>
		<p>If your page already has jQuery included then you can skip this step.</p>
		<pre class="code language-html">
			&lt;!-- Include jQuery (Ajaxy Requirement) --&gt;
			&lt;script type="text/javascript" src="http://www.yoursite.com/somewhere/on/your/webserver/jquery-ajaxy/scripts/jquery-1.4.2.min.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
		</pre>
		
		<h3>Step 4. Include jQuery Ajaxy (insert into your page's head tag)</h3>
		<pre class="code language-html">
			&lt;!-- Include jQuery Ajaxy --&gt;
			&lt;script type="text/javascript" src="http://www.yoursite.com/somewhere/on/your/webserver/jquery-ajaxy/scripts/jquery.ajaxy.min.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

So go ahead, and get that warm fuzzy feeling knowing you just helped some poor fellow working after hours for free to buy his coffee. You only need to spare a few dollars, or as much as you feel this piece of work is worth. Thanks so much. Alternatively; if you are not in a donating mood, then spreading the word about this project on twitter, your blog, or whatever is just as good. You can also give praise by clicking the feedback button or visiting our "Get Support" link. Thanks a bunch, we appreciate the help deeply.
